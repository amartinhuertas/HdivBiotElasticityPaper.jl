# HdivBiotElasticityPaper.jl

Repository that holds the Julia software and computational results reported in Section 7.4 and 7.5 of the paper _"Efficient and reliable divergence-conforming methods for an elasticity-poroelasticity interface problem"_ by _S. Badia, M. Hornkjöl, A. Khan, K.-A. Mardal, A. F. Martín, and R. Ruiz-Baier_. While the results in Section 7.1 of the paper were not actually obtained with the software in this repository, the repository also contains Julia scripts to reproduce the results in this section.
